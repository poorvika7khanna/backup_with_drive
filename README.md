# Backup with Google Drive
This script connects a local folder with your google drive.
Whatever changes you make to your local folder(creating, deleting or updating a file), the same changes will be made to your drive folder.
While running the code for the first time, you will need to change the path to your local directory and also authenticate with your crdentials.
You will have to schedule the script to run every 24 hrs in windows task scheduler.
